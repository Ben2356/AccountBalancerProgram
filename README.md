## WPF Application
The old Account Balancer has been rewritten as a WPF desktop application that runs on Windows.

## Legacy Console Application
_Note: no longer supported_

This console application (only runs on Windows due to usage of WIN32 API) allows a user to balance their Bank of America account, making use of extensive
input validation, color coded text coupled with user readibility in mind, and the ability to go back to prior steps to correct information
